When the normative sample is small, a more appropriate method is to treat the individual as a sample of N = 1 and use a modiﬁed t test described by Sokal and Rohlf (1995). The use of this t test is illustrated with examples and its results compared to those from the standard procedure. It is suggested that the t test be used when the N of the normative sample is less than 50. Finally, a computer program that implements the modiﬁed t-test procedure is described.

Monte Carlo simulation was employed to study the statistical power of two competing approaches to this task. The power to detect a large deficit was low to moderate for a method proposed by Crawford and Howell (1998; ranging from 44\% to 63\%) but was extremely low for a method proposed by Mycroft, Mitchell, and Kay (2002; ranging from 1\% to 13\%). The effects of departures from normality were examined, as was the effect of varying degrees of measurement error in the scores of controls and the single case. Measurement error produced a moderate reduction in power when present in both controls and the case; the effect of differentially greater measurement error for the single case depended on the initial level of power. When Mycroft et al.'s method was used to test for the presence of a classical dissociation, it produced very high Type I error rates (ranging from 20.7\% to 49.3\%); in contrast, the rates for criteria proposed by Crawford and Garthwaite (2005b) were low (ranging from 1.3\% to 6.7\%).

When used as signiﬁcance tests, the two remaining methods (Crawford and Howell’s method and a prediction interval method ﬁrst used by Barton and colleagues) are also equivalent and achieve control of the Type I error rate (the two methods do differ however in other important aspects). A number of broader issues also arise from the present ﬁndings, namely: (a) they underline the value of accompanying signiﬁcance test results with the effect size for the difference between a case and controls, (b) they suggest that less care is often taken over statistical methods than over other aspects of single-case studies, and (c) they indicate that some neuropsychologists have a distorted conception of the nature of hypothesis testing in single-case research (it is argued that this may stem from a failure to distinguish between group studies and single-case studies).},

	abstract = {In contrast to the careful consideration given to the issue of what we can infer from dissociations in single-case studies, the more basic question of how we decide whether a dissociation is present has been relatively neglected. Proposals are made for fully operational definitions of a deficit, classical and strong dissociations, and double dissociations. In developing these definitions it was assumed that they should be based on the use of inferential rather than descriptive statistical methods. The scope of these definitions is limited to typical single-case studies in which patients are compared to control samples of a modest size. The operational definition of a classical dissociation incorporates a requirement that a patient’s performance on Task X is significantly different from Task Y, in addition to the “standard” requirement that the patient has a deficit on Task X and is within normal limits on Task Y. We ran a simulation to estimate the Type I error rates when the criteria for dissociations are applied and found these to be low (Type I errors were defined as identifying an individual from the control population as having a dissociation). The inferential methods for testing whether the various criteria are met make use of t-distributions. These methods are contrasted with the widespread use of z to test for a deficit or a difference between tasks. In the latter approach the statistics of the control sample are treated as parameters; this is not appropriate when, as is normally the case, the control sample size is modest in size.},

When a Type I error was deﬁned as misclassifying a healthy control, error rates were low for both methods. When Type I errors were deﬁned as misclassifying patients with strictly equivalent deﬁcits on two tasks, error rates for strong dissociations were high for the “conventional” criteria and were very high when cases misclassiﬁed as exhibiting either form of dissociation (strong or classical) were combined (maximum = 55.1\%). The power to detect strong and classical dissociations was generally low-to-moderate, but was moderate-to-high in most scenarios when power was deﬁned as the ability to detect either form of dissociation. In most scenarios patients with strong dissociations were more likely to be classiﬁed as exhibiting classical dissociations.

Moreover, there is a large reservoir of published data that could be used to build regression equations; these equations could then be employed to test a wide variety of hypotheses concerning the functioning of individual cases. This resource is currently underused because (a) not all psychologists are aware that regression equations can be built not only from raw data but also using only basic summary data for a sample, and (b) the computations involved are tedious and prone to error. In an attempt to overcome these barriers, Crawford and Garthwaite (2007) provided methods to build and apply simple linear regression models using summary statistics as data. In the present study, we extend this work to set out the steps required to build multiple regression models from sample summary statistics and the further steps required to compute the associated statistics for drawing inferences concerning an individual case. We also develop, describe, and make available a computer program that implements these methods. Although there are caveats associated with the use of the methods, these need to be balanced against pragmatic considerations and against the alternative of either entirely ignoring a pertinent data set or using it informally to provide a clinical “guesstimate.” Upgraded versions of earlier programs for regression in the single case are also provided; these add the point and interval estimates of effect size developed in the present article.},

This method simultaneously provides a point estimate of the percentage of the control population that would exhibit a larger discrepancy.

The methods are implemented in a series of computer programs for PCs (these can be downloaded from www.abdn.ac.uk/wpsy086/dept/Single\_Case\_Covariates.htm). Illustrative examples of the methods are provided.},

(4) In contrast, the method proposed by Corballis is not legitimate for either of these purposes because it fails to allow for uncertainty over the control mean (as a result Type I errors will not be under control).

Comparing an individual’s test score against norms derived from small samples.

Monte Carlo simulation was employed to study the effects of leptokurtosis and the combination of skew and leptokurtosis on the Type I error rates for these two methods. For Crawford and Howell’s method, leptokurtosis produced only a modest inﬂation of the Type I error rate when the control sample N was small-to-modest in size and error rates were lower than the speciﬁed rates at larger N. In contrast, the combination of leptokurtosis and skew produced marked inﬂation of error rates for small Ns. With a speciﬁed error rate of 5\%, actual error rates as high as 14.31\% and 9.96\% were observed for z and Crawford and Howell’s method respectively.

In neuropsychological applications the most common method of making inferences concerning the difference between an individual’s test score and the score predicted by a regression equation is to multiply the standard error of estimate by an appropriate value of z to form conﬁdence limits around the predicted score. The technically correct method is to calculate the standard error of a new individual Y and multiply it by the value of t corresponding to the desired limits (e.g., 90\% or 95\%). These two methods are compared in data sets generated to be broadly representative of data sets used in clinical neuropsychology.},

Extending earlier work by Sokal and Rohlf (1995) and Crawford and Howell (in press), we developed a modiﬁed paired samples t test as an alternative to this formula. Unlike the Payne and Jones formula, the new method treats data from a normative or control sample as sample statistics rather than as population parameters. Technically, the new method is more appropriate for any comparison of an individual’s difference score against normative data. However, it is most useful when the normative data is derived from samples with modest Ns; in these circumstances the Payne and Jones method overestimates the abnormality of differences. We suggest that the modiﬁed t test can be a useful tool in clinical practice and in single-case research. A computer program is made available that automates the calculations involved and can be used to store relevant data for future use.},

              is an entry-level book on Bayesian statistics. It is like no other math book you’ve read. It is written for readers who do not have advanced degrees in mathematics and who may struggle with mathematical notation, yet need to understand the basics of Bayesian inference for scientific investigations. Intended as a “quick read,” the entire book is written as an informal, humorous conversation between the reader and writer—a natural way to present material for those new to Bayesian inference. The most impressive feature of the book is the sheer length of the journey, from introductory probability to Bayesian inference and applications, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches for parameter estimation, Bayesian belief networks, and decision trees. Detailed examples in each chapter contribute a great deal, where Bayes’ Theorem is at the front and center with transparent, step-by-step calculations. A vast amount of material is covered in a lighthearted manner; the journey is relatively pain-free. The book is intended to jump-start a reader’s understanding of probability, inference, and statistical vocabulary that will set the stage for continued learning. Other features include multiple links to web-based material, an annotated bibliography, and detailed, step-by-step appendices.},

	abstract = {The size-weight illusion is a perceptual illusion where smaller objects are judged as heavier than equally weighted larger objects. A previous informal report suggests that visual form agnosic patient DF does not experience the size-weight illusion when vision is the only available cue to object size. We tested this experimentally, comparing the magnitudes of DF’s visual, kinesthetic and visual-kinesthetic size-weight illusions to those of 28 similarly-aged controls. A modified t-test found that DF’s visual size-weight illusion was significantly smaller than that of controls (zcc = −1.7). A test of simple dissociation based on the Revised Standardized Difference Test found that the discrepancy between the magnitude of DF’s visual and kinesthetic size-weight illusions was not significantly different from that of controls (zdcc = −1.054), thereby failing to establish a dissociation between the visual and kinesthetic conditions. These results are consistent with previous suggestions that visual form agnosia, following ventral visual stream damage, is associated with an abnormally reduced size-weight illusion. The results, however, do not confirm that this reduction is specific to the use of visual size cues to predict object weight, rather than reflecting more general changes in the processing of object size cues or in the use of predictive strategies for lifting.},
