	abstract = {The standard method for comparing an individual’s test score with a normative sample involves converting the score to a z score and evaluating it using a table of the area under the normal curve. When the normative sample is small, a more appropriate method is to treat the individual as a sample of N = 1 and use a modiﬁed t test described by Sokal and Rohlf (1995). The use of this t test is illustrated with examples and its results compared to those from the standard procedure. It is suggested that the t test be used when the N of the normative sample is less than 50. Finally, a computer program that implements the modiﬁed t-test procedure is described. This program can be downloaded from the ﬁrst author’s website.},

	abstract = {Neuropsychologists often need to estimate the abnormality of an individual patient’s test score, or test score discrepancies, when the normative or control sample against which the patient is compared is modest in size. Crawford and Howell [The Clinical Neuropsychologist 12 (1998) 482] and Crawford et al. [Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology 20 (1998) 898] presented methods for obtaining point estimates of the abnormality of test scores and test score discrepancies in this situation. In the present study, we extend this work by developing methods of setting conﬁdence limits on the estimates of abnormality. Although these limits can be used with data from normative or control samples of any size, they will be most useful when the sample sizes are modest. We also develop a method for obtaining point estimates and conﬁdence limits on the abnormality of a discrepancy between a patient’s mean score on k-tests and a test entering into that mean. Computer programs that implement the formulae for the conﬁdence limits (and point estimates) are described and made available. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The new (Bayesian) methods provide a signiﬁcance test, point and interval estimates of the effect size for the difference between the case and controls, and point and interval estimates of the abnormality of a case’s score, or standardized score difference. The methods have a wide range of potential applications, e.g., they can provide a means of increasing the statistical power to detect deﬁcits or dissociations, or can be used to test whether differences between a case and controls survive partialling out the effects of potential confounding variables. The methods are implemented in a series of computer programs for PCs (these can be downloaded from www.abdn.ac.uk/wpsy086/dept/Single\_Case\_Covariates.htm). Illustrative examples of the methods are provided.},

	abstract = {Researchers and clinicians in neuropsychology often compare individual patients against healthy control samples, to quantify evidence for cognitive-behavioural deﬁcits and dissociations. Statistical methods for these comparisons have been developed that control Type I (false positive) errors effectively. However, remarkably little attention has been given to the power of these tests. In this practical primer, we describe, in minimally technical terms, the origins and limits of power for caseecontrol comparisons. We argue that power calculations can play useful roles in single-case study design and interpretation, and we make suggestions for optimising power in practice. As well as providing ﬁgures, tables and tools for estimating the power of caseecontrol comparisons, we hope to assist researchers in setting realistic expectations for what such tests can achieve in general.},
